## CarChat

CarChat is a web application that dynamically displays trending news, conversation, and videos in the automobile industry.

Social Media posts are web-scraped from the subreddit [r/cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/) when the user enters the site, and then categorized into three collections.
