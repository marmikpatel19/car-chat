## CarChat

[CarChat](https://carchat.netlify.app) is a web application that dynamically displays trending news, conversations, and videos in the automobile industry.

Social Media posts are web-scraped from the subreddit [r/cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/) when the user opens the application, and then categorized into three collections. CarChat was developed using the MERN stack.
